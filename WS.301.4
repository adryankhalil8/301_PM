Problems with traditional (Waterfall) development.

Hard to be predictive


Agile Principles
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing req. Even late in dev. Agile harness change for the custo competitive advantage

Flexibility
Agility: The ability to adjust to changing conditions.
Customer Involvement
Customers or User representatives are expected to be involved, give opinions and feedback, and help to prioritize next steps.
Multi
disciplinary cooperating teams
Each Scrum team must have specific skills to successfully deliver the project.  By having each member with a broad but shallow understanding of many topics and a deep understanding of one or two topics (for which they will be considered the expert).  This type of ability/skill-set distribution is called a T-shaped skill set.  Enterprises always look for a T-shaped skill set model when selecting development team members.
Trust
Trust is the basic ingredient to be able to deliver the requested quality.

Methodology
Framework
Scrum has no exhaustive and formal prescriptions on how to design and plan the work, actions, and behaviors of all players involved in product development against time.
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions. It is ideal for complex product development, and is iterative and incremental.



Roles
is a set of activities, responsibilities, and/or authorities granted to/performed by a person, group or team.
Rituals
represent actions to be taken or a specific act of work to be performed.
Artifacts
are documents that report, or documentation of some activity that has been performed or is planned to be performed.
Rules
define prescribed behavior or a control mechanism that is intended to be followed.
