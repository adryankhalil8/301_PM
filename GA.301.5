Group Activity - Major Epic – Plan our Wedding
The instructor will assign breakout rooms to groups of four or five. As a group, you need to prioritize the list below and identify if there are important tasks missing from the list.
Your organization has taken on the task of planning and managing the delivery of a wedding.  The bride and groom want to get married but are not very engaged in the process. They want to make decisions and have all the work done by your company.
Below is a list of topics for the wedding. You are about to kick off the project and need to prioritize this list for what needs to happen first, second, etc. Ensure that all of the items that require input from the bride or groom are the first things you do.
